  }
  "owner": {
    "_id": 37,
    "user_name": "Test User",
    "email": "a@b.fi"
  }
}
```

User:

```json
{
  "_id": 37,
  "user_name": "Test User", // this is not username, just firsname lastname
  "email": "john@metropolia.fi", // shoud be unique
  "role": "user", // or "admin" // don't send this
  "password": "1234" // don't send this
}
```
